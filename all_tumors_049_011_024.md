Generate a header file to load into R. The order is the order that the samples get loaded. This should also match the shortnames later. 

this is for ALL samples for principal component analysis (the simplest form of multidimentional scaling), and also a file for pairwise comparisons. since we have a ton of comparisisons, might just not do this for now and only do the PCA.
